My progression so far to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event.
Not the best solutions, but those are mine.

Puzzles I've found particularly challenging (descending order):

- Day 12 (part two) (+ poor implementation: takes 3sec in Python, minutes with my Elixir take)
- Day 5 (part two)
- Day 8 (part two)

Languages I've used for the very first time this month (descending order of preference):

- Ruby
- Elixir 
- Go
- Julia
- Java
