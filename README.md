My solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event.
Not the best solutions, but those are mine.

As puzzles became more and more difficult, it became harder keeping up with a new language every day.
From day 13 I started back using Python to solve problems.
I will share my solutions after cleaning and translating them.

That was my first time doing AoC and probably not the last as it made me learn interesting concepts and discover new languages.

Puzzles I've found particularly challenging (descending order):

- Day 21 (part two)
- Day 24 (part two)
- Day 17 (part one implementation)
- Day 12 (part two) (+ poor implementation: takes 3sec in Python, minutes with my Elixir take)
- Day 5  (part two)
- Day 8  (part two)

Languages I've used for the very first time this month:

- Ruby 
- Lisp
- Go
- OCaml
- Lua
- Elixir
- TypeScript
- Julia
- Clojure
- Boo
- Groovy
- Kotlin
- C#
- Java
